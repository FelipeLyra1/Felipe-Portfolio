                I am someone who's deeply passionate about coding and the ever-evolving world of Coding. My journey in this field started when I completer the Rice University Coding BootCamp, and because of it is driven by an insatiable love for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions through code. I embrace the challenges that come with the territory, as they fuel my desire to learn and adapt.

                I also have a deep appreciation for collaboration and effective communication. During my time at The Walt Disney World, I honed my communication skills, particularly in assisting guests when they encountered inconveniences or unexpected issues, swiftly turning their experiences magical within just a brief interaction. This experience ignited a passion in me for developing software solutions that can enhance the quality of people's lives.

                In my journey as a coder, I've come to appreciate the intricate balance of technical expertise and the human element in problem-solving. I'm excited about leveraging my skills and experiences to create software that doesn't just meet functional needs but genuinely enhances people's lives. When I began learning to code, I didn't anticipate how rewarding it would be to see my envisioned projects come to life. Now, I'm eager to code even more.
